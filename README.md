⚙️ How It Works
📡 Data Collection
Ultrasonic sensors monitor underpass water levels.

Cameras/AI modules detect potholes in real-time.

🧠 Data Processing
Sensor and detection data is sent to the backend.

Server processes and stores data in Firebase (or MongoDB).

🖥️ Visualization & Alerts
Web clients display data on dashboards and maps.

Admins/users receive notifications for detected hazards.

🚀 Getting Started
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/flood-monitering-system.git
Follow setup steps for each component (client, server, AI, Arduino).

Deploy frontend and backend (e.g., Vercel for client, Render/Heroku for server).
