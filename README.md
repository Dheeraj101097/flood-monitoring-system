## ⚙️ Features

### 🌊 Flood Detection System
- Real-time water level monitoring using ultrasonic sensors
- Dashboard for water level visualization
- Alert system for flooded underpasses
- Historical data analysis

### 🕳️ Pothole Detection System
- AI-based pothole detection from road images
- Interactive map with pothole locations
- Pothole severity level visualization
- Maintenance request management
